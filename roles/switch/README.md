# Data Models

## Infrastructure

Basic autogenerated data model for an eBGP-based leaf/spine fabric.

Spines all use same ASN.  Each Leaf has a unique ASN (ASN would be shared between MLAG peers in real-life, but this is the lab...)

infra-dm.yml defines the parameters of the fabric:

* maxspines: Maximum number of spines ever - so we don't end-up readdresing links if we add spines.
* spines: Number of spines in fabric.
* leaves: Number of leaves in fabric.
* baseasn: Base ASN - also spine ASN.
* p2plength: Prefix-length for point-to-point links - typically 31 or 30.
* loopbackprefix: Subnet (in CIDR notation) from which to allocate loopback IPs.  Leaves start at bottom, Spines at top.
* loopbackint: Loopback interface number.
* p2pprefix: Subnet (in CIDR notation) from which point-to-point links are allocated.
* firstuplink: First interface to use as uplink - e.g. 45 if you wanted to use Eth45-48 inclusive as uplinks in a 4-spine network.
* leafprefix: Hostname prefix for leaves.
* spineprefix: Hostname prefix for spines.

These parameters are used by infra-dm.j2, infra-spine.j2 and infra-leaf.j2.  They generate a file in output/infra-$HOSTNAME.yml.  This is then read back in by the playbook and used by infra-config.j2 to generate output/infra-$HOSTNAME-config.txt.

Some basic validation of the data model takes place using assertions too.
